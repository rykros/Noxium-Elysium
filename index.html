                <p>Hello! I'm Ricky "Rykros" Runyon, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to Noxium Elysium, my personal webspace. This site serves as a platform to showcase my work in web design and development, alongside my pursuit of full-stack engineering. A highlight of the site is dedicated to the beloved Sega Genesis RPG, <a href="./psiv/index.html">Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium</a>, a game that holds a special place in my heart. You'll find detailed bios for all the main characters, as well as information on the Hunter's Guild jobs. I also plan to update general information and features for all of the original Phantasy Star games over time. For those interested in my journey, the <a href="./about.html">About page</a> features my Codecademy certifications and provides insight into my current projects. I invite you to explore the site, and if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out via email! You can also find links to my GitHub and social media accounts in the footer. Thank you for visiting!</p>
