                <p><img src="../assets/psiv-gfx/hunters-guild.png" alt="Hunter's Guild" class="hunters-guild">The Hunter's Guild is a key organization in Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, located in the bustling town of Aiedo on the desert planet of Motavia. As a professional guild for mercenaries, the Hunter's Guild offers various jobs to its members, ranging from simple tasks like escort missions to more dangerous ones involving monster extermination and bounty hunting.</p>
                <p>Players can visit the guild throughout the game to accept side quests, known as “jobs,” which provide rewards such as money, items, and valuable experience. These missions often delve deeper into the world of Phantasy Star IV, introducing new characters, uncovering hidden lore, and sometimes even offering humorous or unexpected outcomes.</p>
                <p>The Hunter's Guild serves as a major hub for Chaz and his companions, who frequently take on these jobs to aid the citizens of Motavia, solve mysteries, and gather resources during their journey. It also reflects the societal need for freelance hunters in a world teetering on the edge of chaos, as various threats loom over the Algo Star System.</p>
