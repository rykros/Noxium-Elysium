                <p><img src="../assets/psiv-gfx/title-screen.png" alt="Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium" class="psiv-title-screen"><span>Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium</span> is the grand finale of SEGA's beloved Phantasy Star series, originally released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. Set within the futuristic Algo Star System, the game follows Chaz Ashley, a young hunter, and his mentor, Alys Brangwin, as they investigate a sinister force threatening to engulf their world. Along the way, they're joined by a diverse cast of allies, each with their own skills and backgrounds, from the technologically advanced android Wren to the mysterious Esper, Rune Walsh.</p>
                <p>The game features an engaging turn-based combat system, with options like macros allowing for strategic team coordination in battles. Players can explore a variety of planets—each with unique environments and challenges—while uncovering long-lost secrets of Algo's past and connections to the earlier games in the series. One of the game's standout features is its use of manga-style cutscenes to advance the plot, delivering an emotional and cinematic storytelling experience.</p>
                <p>Phantasy Star IV is renowned for its balance between science fiction and fantasy, blending space-age technology with ancient magic and mythical creatures. For fans of classic JRPGs, the game offers a richly rewarding experience, tying together years of narrative threads into a satisfying conclusion for the series.</p>

                <p>The long, long struggle of ancient times finally ended...</p>
                <p>The victor sacrificed the vanquished to the heavens.</p>

                <p>The Algo solar system, somewhere in space...</p>
                <p>Once a brilliant civilization flourished here. The citizens devoted themselves to art and the sciences, and life was prosperous and good.</p>
                <p>Then a series of disasters struck. The system-wide management system, 'Mother Brain,' was destroyed. So was the first planet, Parma. Over 90% of the system's population died, and the advanced technological culture was lost.</p>
                <p>Society declined, spiralling downward until at last only a few scattered groups even remembered there once were better times.</p>
                <p>A thousand years passed.</p>
                <p>At last, civilization is once more on the rise across the Algo system. People are again turning to thoughts of an easier life. Old knowledge is being rediscovered.</p>
                <p>But just as things look brighter, beyond a threshold long thought closed, a dark and very ancient evil stirs...</p>
