        			<h4>Summary of the Planets</h4>
          			<p>In the original Phantasy Star franchise, multiple planets make up the Algo Star System. Palma housed the Palmans, a technologically advanced human race believed to hail from Earth. Palma was destroyed after colliding with the satellite Gaila, and its surviving inhabitants migrated to Motavia, Dezolis, and other reaches of space. Motavia is a desert-like planet home to the primitive bird-like Motavians. Dezolis is a cold planet inhabited by the Dezorians, who worship the Great Light and the Profound Darkness. After Palma's destruction, the Palmans settled on Motavia and Dezolis. The final planet of the system, Rykros, was created by the Great Light to complete the seal that keeps the Profound Darkness at bay every millennium after Palma's destruction.</p>

Palma was destroyed after colliding with the satellite Gaila, and its surviving inhabitants migrated to Motavia, Dezolis, and other reaches of space.

        		<section class="motavia">
          			<h4>Motavia</h4>
          			<p>Phantasy Star II, III, and IV begin on the planet Motavia. In Phantasy Star I, Motavia is a desert planet that is home to the native bird-like Motavians. In Phantasy Star II, Mother Brain influences technological advancements that make the planet more habitable. Even after Rolf and his party eventually defeat Mother Brain, the planet flourishes with lush forests and thriving civilization. However, the destruction of Mother Brain leads to the malfunctioning of the planet's control systems over time. By the events of Phantasy Star IV, Motavia has reverted to a desert planet. Motavia is also one of the three planets that contribute to the seal against the Profound Darkness.</p>
        		</section>
        		<section class="dezolis">
          			<h4>Dezolis</h4>
          			<p>Dezolis is a cold planet inhabited by the Dezorians, who are deeply religious and worship both the Great Light and the Profound Darkness. The Esper Mansion on Dezolis serves as a sanctuary and training ground for psychics, particularly those associated with the Lutz bloodline and the Espers. It is a place where individuals can hone their psychic abilities and gain wisdom. Dezolis is the third planet that plays a role in sealing away the Profound Darkness.</p>

        		<section class="rykros">
          			<h4>Rykros</h4>
          			<p>Rykros is depicted as a mysterious, ethereal planet, characterized by its otherworldly environment and connection to the cosmic forces of Light and Darkness. The planet is only visited in Phantasy Star IV by Chaz and his party. After the destruction of Palma, the seal against the Profound Darkness was compromised, prompting the Great Light to create a fourth planet to help maintain the seal against evil. Every millennium, Rykros appears to keep the seal intact; however, the Profound Darkness continues to project its hatred through the entity Dark Force throughout the series.</p>
        		</section>
				<section class="conclusion">
					<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
					<p>Space exploration is a key feature of the Phantasy Star series, enriching the narrative of this space fantasy game. Understanding each planet adds depth to the story and provides insight into the events that unfold throughout the series. It is theorized that the characters in Phantasy Star Online are descendants of survivors from Palma. It would be intriguing for Sega to officially acknowledge this theory in future lore or games.</p>
