          			<h4>The Beginning</h4>
          			<p>From a young age, I've always enjoyed the roar of a powerful engine, the whistling of a turbocharger, and the clicking of a ratchet. But as much as I loved working with my hands, I also had a strong love for technology. My passion for cars and trucks led me to start my career in the automotive industry eight years ago. Growing up in poverty, we had to learn to fix mechanical issues ourselves when it came to our own vehicles. I found out quickly that I was very mechanically inclined and enjoyed repairing things. My driving skills were strong, thanks in part to my OCD. In high school, I had three career choices in mind: automotive technician, software engineer, or automotive racing. However, I didn't actively pursue any of them. Growing up in poverty and struggling with mental health challenges led to many difficulties as both a teenager and an adult.</p>

          			<h4>My Sojourn</h4>
          			<p>Embarrassingly enough, I've held many different jobs due to my inability to maintain steady employment. I've worked in numerous positions such as stocker, cashier, warehouse worker, truck driver, lab technician, plant controller, machine operator, and sheet metal mechanic. And the list goes on. After two children and a failed marriage, I was able to get my mental health under control and actually start bettering myself. I wanted a better life for myself and my children. That's when I began searching for the right career. I knew I had to start from the bottom, even at an older age. I began my career in the automotive field. Even though I had set my career later in life, I felt like I was now working towards something meaningful. Now I could actually do something for myself, with myself, and have a goal to work towards. For myself, my current wife, and teenage children.</p>

          			<h4>Automotive Technician</h4>
          			<p>Like I mentioned, I had to start from the bottom. The bottom as an automotive technician is an oil and tire technician. I say bottom, but it's still a respectful position. As an oil and tire tech, you help customers with maintenance of their vehicles they use daily to go to work, run errands, go to doctor's appointments, etc. A customer's vehicle needs to be safe and reliable, and an oil and tire tech is the first step to achieving that. I eventually moved up to manage the same shop where I started, but it wasn't the right fit for me. I had the opportunity to do more mechanic work at a local business. I moved up to suspension work, alignments, light electrical, tire pressure monitoring systems, and brakes. I then saw the opportunity on a job board for BMW as a service technician. I sent in my resume, and the rest is history. I have been working on BMWs for four years, and I thoroughly enjoy the work and the challenge it provides. After jumping from job to job and working on some of the most sophisticated cars in the world, I became curious about how the software made them so advanced. As I became more skilled, I realized my true fascination was not just in the mechanics but in the software that powered these vehicles.</p>

          			<h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          			<p>Even though I enjoy my career, I have always felt it was more a love for the technology. I will always get enjoyment from working on cars, but I enjoy learning how the technology works. I've always been intrigued by how software makes hardware function, creating an interface that allows us to interact with technology seamlessly. That fascination only deepened as I worked on today's cars, especially BMWs, which rely on multiple control units to manage everything from engine performance to safety features. Each unit is controlled by software that dictates how the injectors and spark plugs function, how the windows and sunroof operate, how the locks and alarm system engage, how the fuel pump runs, and how the tire pressure monitoring system worksâ€”among countless other things. I want to learn how to manipulate and control technology using software. I want to design software to be more efficient and to make our lives better and easier, or just more fun and entertaining. I have already begun to delve into this career by taking classes on Codecademy. My webproject, Noxium Elysium, helps me practice what I learn.</p>

          			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
          			<p>I feel, at my age, that not only will a software engineering career be more rewarding but also easier on my body. I want to show my teenage children that the only way you can achieve the things you want in life is to work hard and never give up. And to never let anything get in the way of your happiness and success. They see me exhausted after a long day of turning wrenches, but still able to provide for them. They see my projects and are impressed, and understand that this career I'm working hard towards will reap many benefits. I look forward to seeing what I can bring to the world with the skills I will acquire in my journey. I encourage anyone with a goal to work hard to achieve it, knowing that it can lead to a happier, more fulfilling life. I hope to inspire not only my children but to anyone who sees my journey. It's never too late to pursue a path that aligns with your passions and brings you closer to your true potential.</p>
